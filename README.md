## Roadmap

<!-- Link to [Trello](https://trello.com/b/j4Rx38rw/hacqthemoney) -->

Project:
 - Spin up private blockchain. Use Polygon for this. ‚ùå`
 - Find out how to replace the consensus. ‚ùå
 - Clone Uniswap, both core and exchange. üéØ
 - Deploy on own blockchain. ‚ùå
 - Implement sponsor challenge features such as cross-chain transfers.
   - Swing for cross-chain swaps.
   - theGraph for transaction data for visualization.


## Fantom

Deploying Uniswap contracts to Fantom testnet.

## L2blockchains / zkRollups

[PolygonZero](https://polygon.technology/solutions/polygon-zero/) and [codeBase](https://github.com/mir-protocol/plonky2)
[Fantom](https://www.fantom.foundation/lachesis-consensus-algorithm/) and [codeBase](https://github.com/Fantom-foundation/go-opera)
[zkSync](https://v2-docs.zksync.io/dev/)
[Swing](https://swing.xyz/developers) cross chain API - lots of docs and workshops
[WorldCoin](https://jumpy-seat-486.notion.site/World-ID-Hack-ideas-14cfabb4c6c849eea3cc2ecb39f4710f) proof of humanness. Could be used to facilitate a single transaction per user to FTM coin, which then allows further swaps.
